1. color code in network. In the original proposal, we did not discuss how we would
	color-code the network. It can be used as a selection for users to choose 
	how to color code the network. By genre, by game type, or by certain score threshold.
2. Percentage of match genre. Given two particular games/genre of games, how much they
	are similar in other factors.
3. Search. It can be nice if the user can search the information of a particular game.
4. Zoom on Netwrok. Semantic zoom on network so it is easier to see the bigger picture,
	then gives more detail when zoomed in
5. Mutiple selection and see shared neighborhood. In the network, it would be nice if the
	user can select 2 or more nodes, and the network shows what neighbors they share.
